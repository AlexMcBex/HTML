The GitHub Flow
The workflow for contributing to an open-source product or your dev teamâ€™s project comprises the following steps:

Forking
Cloning
Editing
Adding/committing
Pushing
Submitting a pull request

1) Forking
    add someone's repo to your github account, the repo includes the code and 
    the commit history.
    every change committed to the copy doesn't affect the original repository
2) Cloning
    Cloning a repo will make it avaiable on your machine so you can work on it.
    git clone https://url-to-clone
    to copy the url on gitbash on windows the shortcuts are
    ctrl + Ins instead of ctrl + C 
    shift + Ins instead of ctrl + V
3) Editing
    Using a text editor to apply your edits to the code (check Atom or Sublime)
4) Adding/committing
    Update your repo with your changes
5) Pushing
    Update your remote repository with 
    git push origin master
    origin is a shortcut for the URL of the repository
    master is the branch
6) Submitting a pull request
    this shares your changes with the owner of the original repo

       
$ git pull origin main  --allow-unrelated-histories
